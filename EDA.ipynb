There are a few exceptions      Foch 155   The only reason this is still high is because so many of the games played over the existence of this tank were before the great nerfing     VK 72.01K   This is higher than the E 100 in spite of being blatantly worse.     STB 1   Higher than just about any med  sure the STB is pretty great  but I wouldn't rate it as the best med.     215b   One of the best tanks in the game  has lower expected than the E 100  this is in a large part due to how the E 100 is idiot proof  and thus friendier on noobs  while the 215b is not.     FV4202   Why isn't this the lowest in tier  instead it's almost the same as the 215b  which is about as good as the 4202 is bad.     E5 expected is still way too low  and it will go up  even if the tank is nerfed.     113 is higher than the maus. Maus is pretty decent  113 is certainly not.     T62a is still waaay too low on the expected  seriously it's still lower than the 121.     M60 is lowest in tier  no idea why  it's actually pretty solid  arguably comparable to the leo  and certainly better than the 121  and 4202.        Which tanks do you see changing based on recent release trends with v24      T110E5     T110E5     T110E5       Seriously though  I think the trend we see now is likely to continue  getting good stat in meds is still too easy  although that may just be a skill ceiling thing. We will see things that are worse than they used to be continue to lose expected  like the waffle  F155 and T57.    Are you targeting any specific tanks to play more as a result of this    Fuck no. I play the tanks that I enjoy  stats be fucked. Not caring about stats beyond an indicator of how well I'm doing in a certain tank is one of the best things to do if I want to enjoy this game  and not end up killing myself when  this   fucks my MoE wn8 again.\")"
